"""Composable predicate filters (Strategy pattern).

Each rule is a predicate ``Job -> bool`` (True = keep). ``build_predicates``
returns only the predicates the config enables; a job must pass all of them.
A new rule type (max posting age, salary floor, ...) is one new block here -
existing predicates are never edited.
